Ronald Jones was stopped short on consecutive carries as Arians stuck to his 'No risk it, no biscuit' philosophy and went on fourth down.But Kansas City didn't gain any momentum off the stop. Instead, they made one costly mistake after another.First, All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce dropped a pass that would've been a big gain on third down. Then punter Tommy Townsend shanked a 29-yarder after a penalty forced him to kick again.The Bucs started at Kansas City's 38 instead of their 27.A holding call on Kansas City cornerback Charvarius Ward negated an interception by All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu. Kansas City's defence held but an offside penalty during Ryan Succop's successful field goal gave the Buccaneers a first down. Sarah Thomas, the first woman official in a Super Bowl, threw that flag.</p>"
